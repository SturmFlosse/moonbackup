In this repository you will find scripts and guides for powering on a truenas system, running replication jobs and powering the system off again - all fully automated.

Take a close look at the scripts for yourself and really try to understand how to use them. These were created for a special use case and should be treated this way.

I am not a professional programmer and never will be but I wanted this solution so I did a lot of research and got these scripts working. Also I don't have much experience using Github but I read online that many other people are searching for the same solutions. So I thought it might help others as well. 

If you see improvements, please let me and others know and maybe we can implement changes in the scripts.  

If you find the scripts and guidelines helpful and you feel the need to thank me for publishing them, please don't. I am not doing this for money or something else. If you feel the need, donate some money to your local animal shelter or something else. Thanks :)
